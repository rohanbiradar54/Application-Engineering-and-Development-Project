E ADOPTION PORTAL

Every year nearly thousands of mothers try to abort a child and thousands of families tries to adopt a child. Even then more than 50% of these kids are unhappy with their assigned family, which leads to mistrust in these adoption agencies. To overcome this challenge, we have come up with the idea of E-Adoption portal, where systematic flow of adoption takes place. This system has 10 users- System Administrator, Financial Administrator, Hospital Administrator, Lawyer Administrator, Parent, Counselor, Birth Mother, Banker, Lawyer and Investment Manager; 4 enterprises- legal, Orphanage, Hospital and Financial; and 7 organizations â€“ Lawyer, Orphanage, Birth Mother, Parent, Counselor, Bank and Insurance.

Workflow-

Birth Mother will register and wait for the application to get approved by Counselor and Hospital Administrator

After getting approved the birth mother will get the email notification

Later she can choose the parent (approved by lawyer and counselor and hadmin) who have applied in the portal

Parent gets an email notification and can decide whether to adopt or not

If required Birth Mother can ask for the funds from the Bank Manager and can claim insurance from the insurance manager

In this system you can also view the dashboard of birth mother and parents which will tell us the summary about the user

Orphanage is another Enterprose which requires approval from Counselor & parents can schedule a meeting with available orphan
